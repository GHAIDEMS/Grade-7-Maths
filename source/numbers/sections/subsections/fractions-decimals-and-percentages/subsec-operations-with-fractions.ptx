                    In everyday life, you often come across situations 
                    where we need to add or subtract parts of a whole—like pieces of 
                    cake, distances, or time. These parts are represented as fractions. 
                    Sometimes, we deal with mixed numbers, which are whole numbers combined 
                    with fractions, like <m>2 \frac{1}{2}</m> In this lesson, you’ll learn how to add 
                    and subtract mixed numbers with unlike denominators.

                        Convert unlike fractions to like fractions
                        by finding the LCM of the denominators.
