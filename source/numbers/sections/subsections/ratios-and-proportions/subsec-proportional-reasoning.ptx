        <title>Using the proportional reasoning to find missing values. </title>
        <p>
            Proportional reasoning is a method of solving problems that involve ratios and proportions. 
            It is based on the idea that if two ratios are equal, then the quantities involved are in proportion. 
            This means that if you know one ratio, you can use it to find the missing value in another ratio.
        </p>
        <p>
            For, example if;
            <me>
                \frac{part}{whole} = \frac{part}{whole}
            </me>
            then we can find the missing value by cross-multiplying and solving for the unknown.

                Form groups of 2-3 students and discuss the following:
            </p>
            <p>
                1. How can you use proportional reasoning to find the missing value in a ratio?
            </p>
            <p>
                2. Can you think of a real-life example where you would use proportional reasoning to find a missing value?

                Work in pairs to solve the following problems:
            </p>
            <p>
                1. If 3 apples cost $1.50, how much do 5 apples cost?
            </p>
            <p>
                2. If a car travels 60 miles in 1 hour, how far will it travel in 2 hours?
            </p>
        </activity>
        <example>
            <statement>
                <p>
                    <m>60%</m> of the students in a school of <m>?</m> learners are girls. 
                    If there are <m>300</m> girls, how many students are in the whole school?
                </p>
            </statement>
            <solution>
                <p>
                    To find the total number of students in the school, we can set up a proportion:
                    <me>
                        \frac{300}{x} = \frac{60}{100}
                    </me>
                    where <m>x</m> is the total number of students in the school.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Cross-multiplying gives us:
                    <me>
                        300 \times 100 = 60 \times x
                    </me>
                </p>
                <p>
                    Simplifying gives us:
                    <me>
                        30000 = 60x
                    </me>
                </p>
                <p>
                    Dividing both sides by <m>60</m> gives us:
                    <me>
                        x = \frac{30000}{60} = 500
                    </me>
                </p>
            </solution>
        </example>
        <example>
            <statement>
                <p>
                    A family spent GHâ‚µ <m>75</m>, which is <m>25%</m> of their monthly budget. 
                    What is their full monthly budget?
                </p>
            </statement>
            <solution>
                <p>
                    To find the full monthly budget, we can set up a proportion:
                    <me>
                        \frac{75}{x} = \frac{25}{100}
                    </me>
                    where <m>x</m> is the full monthly budget.
