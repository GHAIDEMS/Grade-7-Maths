    <title>Highest Factor (HCF) and Least Common Multiple (LCM)</title>
    
        <p>
            HCF is the largest positive integer number that divides evenly into two or more numbers with zero remainder.
            It is also known as the Highest Common Factor (HFC).
        </p>
    
        <p>
                Example in real life:
        </p>
        <p>
                Esther and Shillah have packets of snacks and want to share them equally amoung the top mathematics performers in grade <m>7</m> without leaving leftovers.
                Esther have <m>36</m> crackers and Shillah has <m>54</m> cookies.
        </p>
        <p>
                 The largest number of top performers Shillah and Esther can gift is solved using GCD.
        </p>
        <p>
                Since the factors of <m>36</m> are <m>1,2,3,4,6,9,12,18,36</m> and the factors of <m>54</m> are <m>1,2,3,6,9,18,27,54</m>. 
                This implies that the higher number of top performers to be gifted is <m>18</m>.

                <p>
                    Multiples of <m>5:</m> are <m>5, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30, {\color{blue}35}, 40, 45,50,55,60,65,{\color{blue}70},75,...</m>

                    or <m>18</m> cm without a remainder?

                     we need to find the Least Common Multiple (LCM) of these three numbers.
