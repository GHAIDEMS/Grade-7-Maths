    <title>Powers of numbers</title>
    <introduction>
        <p>
            The power of a number is the result of multiplying that number by itself a certain number of times. 
            For example, <m>2^3</m> (read as "two to the power of three") means <m>2 \times 2 \times 2 = 8</m>. 
            The number <m>2</m> is called the base, and <m>3</m> is called the exponent or index. 
            The exponent indicates how many times the base is multiplied by itself.

            <title>Understanding repeated factors through grouping and counting objects</title>
            <p>
                The concept of powers can be understood through the idea of grouping and counting objects. 
                For example, if we have <m>2^3</m>, we can think of it as having <m>2</m> groups of <m>3</m> objects each. 
                This helps in visualizing the multiplication process and understanding the concept of powers.
            </p>
            <p>
                To illustrate this, consider the following example:
                If we have <m>2^3</m>, we can represent it as:
                <m>2 \times 2 \times 2 = 8</m>.
                This means we have <m>2</m> groups of <m>3</m> objects each, resulting in a total of <m>8</m> objects.
