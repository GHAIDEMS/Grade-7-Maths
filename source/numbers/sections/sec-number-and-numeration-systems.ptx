         <p>
            Numbers are abstract concepts that represent quantities or values. They can be <em>whole numbers, fractions, or even irrational numbers</em>.
          </p>
          <p>Numerals, on the other hand, are the symbols we use to represent these numbers. For example, the number "five"
             can be represented by the numeral "5" in Arabic numerals or "V" in Roman numerals or "ðŸ”µ ðŸ”µ ðŸ”µ  
             ðŸ”µ ðŸ”µ
           " in pictorials.

            How would life be different without numbers? Talk with your classmates and list five things you do every day that involve numbers.

            Some examples to help you think:
            
                How do we know what time to wake up or go to school?
            
                How do farmers measure land or seeds?
            
                How do we know how much to pay at the shop?
            
                How do we count people in class?
            
                How do doctors know the right amount of medicine?

           <p>An<m> {\color{blue}{\textbf{integer}}}</m> is a number without a fractional part. Integers can be positive, negative, or zero. All whole numbers are integers. Here are some examples of integers:
            â€“42, â€“2, 0, 3, 180</p>
            <p>
               <m>{\color{blue}{\textbf{Integers on number lines}}}</m>
               You can plot integers on number lines. On a number line, negative integers are to the left of zero, and positive integers are to the right of zero.

               <m>\textbf{What are rational numbers?}</m>
               A <m>\textbf{rational number}</m> is any number that can be made by dividing two integers.
           </p>
            <p>
               Remember that integers can be positive numbers, negative numbers or zero, but they cannot have fractional or decimal parts.
               All rational numbers can be written in the form
               <m>\frac{p}{q}</m>
               where p and q are integers and q is not zero.
            </p>
            <p>
               <m>\frac{2}{3}</m>is a rational number. </p>
            <p>
               <m>-5</m> is a rational number because it can be written as
               <m>\frac{-5}{1}</m>
           </p>
            <p>
             4.75 is a rational number because it can be written as <m>\frac{19}{4}</m>
            </p>
            <p>         
             0.36  is a rational number because it can be written as <m>\frac{9}{25}</m>
            </p>
            <p>
            1.18 is a rational number because it can be written as <m>\frac{13}{11}</m>
            </p>
            <p>
            Integers, fractions, terminating decimal and repeating decimals are all rational numbers.

            <m>\textbf{A rational number}</m>
               is any number that can be made by dividing two integers. Rational numbers can be positive, negative, or zero. They can be integers, fractions, terminating decimals and repeating decimals.
               <m>\textbf{Adding rational numbers}</m></p>
            <p>
             To add rational numbers, follow these steps:
            </p>
            <p>
             Make sure both two numbers to be added have the same form. They should both be fractions or both be decimals. If the numbers are fractions, write them to have common denominators
          </p>
         <p>
            Look at the signs of the numbers to be added to determine how to solve. If the addends have the same sign add their absolute values
         </p>
          <p>
            If the addends have different signs, subtract the lesser absolute value from the greater absolute value.
            Determine the sign of the sum. If the rational numbers have the same sign, the sum will have that sign. If the addends have different signs, the sum will have the sign of the addend with the greater absolute value.

               </md>
            </p>
            <p>
            So <m>-\frac{1}{4} +(-\frac{3}{5}) = \frac{-5}{20} + (\frac{-12}{20})</m>
            </p>
            <p>
             Now look at the sign of the rational numbers to be added they are the same that is (-) and a positive number times a negative number is a negative one so our answer will be:
            </p>
          <p> 
            So since the signs are the same we will add 1.e <m>\frac{5}{20} + \frac{12}{20} = \frac{17}{20}</m>
          </p>
          <p>
               Lastly, determine the sign of the sum. Since bth addends are negative, the sum will also be negative

               
            <m> = -\frac{17}{20}</m>

            Subtracting rational numbers with differrent signs.
               Subtracting a number is the same as adding its opposite
               For example, 5 â€“ 2 is the same as 5 + (-2)
              
               So, you can rewrite a subtraction expression as addition of the opposite. Then, follow the rules for adding rational numbers.
            </p>
               <example>
                  <statement>
                     <p>
                      Solve <m>8\frac{3}{5} + (-2.5)</m>
                     </p>
                  </statement>
                  <solution>
                     <p>
                        First we write the numbers in the same form. Write <m>8\frac{3}{5}</m> as a decimal i.e <m> (8 \times 5 = 40 + 3 = \frac{43}{5} = 8.6 )</m>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        Since the signs of the addends are different , so subtract the lesser absolute value from the greater absolute value.
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        So <m>8\frac{3}{5} + (-2.5) = 8.6 -2.5 = 6.1</m> 
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        Since the positive number in our sum is larger than the negative one the sum is positive i.e :
                        <m>8\frac{3}{5} + (-2.5)</m> = 6.1
                     </p>

                  <m>\textbf{How do you order rational numbers?}</m>
                   You can order rational numbers using what you know about comparing rational numbers.
              </p>
               <p>
                 To order rational numbers, follow these steps:
               </p>
                <p>
                1. Write the numbers in the same form. You can write them all as fractions or all as decimals.
                  
               </p>
               <p>
                2. Compare the numbers. You can use a number line to help you compare the numbers.
                  
               </p>
               <p>
                3. Write the numbers in order from least to greatest or from greatest to least.
              </p>
             <example>
               <statement>
                  <p>
                     Put these rational numbers in order from least to greatest:
             
                    <m>\frac{1}{2}, \frac{3}{4}, \frac{1}{3}, \frac{2}{5}</m>
            
                  </p>
               </statement>
               <solution>
                  <p>
                     First, write the numbers in the same form. Write all the numbers as fractions.
                     <m>\frac{1}{2} = \frac{5}{10}, \frac{3}{4} = \frac{15}{20}, \frac{1}{3} = \frac{10}{30}, \frac{2}{5} = \frac{12}{30}</m>
                     Now, compare the fractions. 
                  </p>
                  <p> 
                     To compare fractions, look at the denominators and find theit LCM.
                     The LCM of 10, 20, and 30 is 60.

                     â€“<m>\frac{1}{2}</m> is the smallest number.

                     <m>2\frac{3}{10}</m> = 2.3 Since 2.3 is less than 2.32, <m>2\frac{3}{10}</m> comes next.
                        
                     </p>
                     <p>
                     That leaves 2.32 as the largest number.

                     <p>

            Irrational Numbers
           </p>
           <p>
            What are irrational numbers?
            Any number that is not rational is irrational.
            An irrational number cannot be made by dividing two integers. 
           </p>
           <p>
            
           Irrational numbers that are written as decimals never terminate and never repeat.

           <m> \sqrt{2}</m>is an irrational number because it cannot be written as a fraction is 1.4142135623
           <m>\pi</m> is an irrational number because it cannot be written as a fraction but, â€‹<m>\pi</m> can be wtitten as 3.14159265358â€¦

            How do you compare rational numbers?
            When you compare rational numbers, it often helps to use a number line.
            It can also help to write both numbers in the same form. You can write them both as fractions or as decimals. If the numbers are fractions, you can write them to have a common denominator
            to make them easier to compare.

               </statement>
               <solution>
                  <p>
                    Since 0.2 is positive and -0.4 is negative, 0.2 is greater than -0.4
                    .
                    The number 0.2 is farther right on the number line.

               <p>So, to understand irrational numbers, you need to first understand rational numbers.
               A rational number is a number that can be made by dividing two integers.
               You can write any rational number as a fraction.
             </p> 
              <p>
               <m>{\color{blue}{\textbf{7}}}</m> is a rational number because it can be written as <m>\frac{7}{1}</m>.
               3.25 is a rational number because it can be written as <m>\frac{13}{4}</m>
               1.54 is a rational number because it can be written as <m>\frac{17}{11}</m>
              
               <m>\textbf{Irrational Numbers}</m> are numbers that are not rational. So, an irrational number is any number that cannot be made by dividing two integers.

              <p>Irrational numbers cannot be written as fractions. Irrational numbers written as decimals never terminate and never repeat.
               â€‹<m>\pi</m>, the number pi,is an irrational number because it cannot be written as a fraction and it does not terminate or repeat when written as a decimal. â€‹<m>\pi</m> is 3.1415926535...
               <m>\textbf{Euler's number}</m>, is an irrational number because it cannot be written as a fraction and it does not terminate or repeat when written as a decimal is 2.7182818284...
               <m>\textbf{Square roots}</m>
              </p>
              <p>
               Many square roots are irrational. <m>\sqrt{2}</m> is an irrational number.<m>\sqrt{40}</m>  is 1.4142135623
              </p>
              <p>
               But, be careful! Not all square roots are irrational. Some square roots are rational.
               25 is a rational number.25 <m>\sqrt{25}</m> is 5, or<m>\frac{5}{1}</m>
