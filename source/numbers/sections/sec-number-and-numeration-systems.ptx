         <title>Numbers and Numerals</title>
         <p>
            Numbers are abstract concepts that represent quantities or values. They can be <em>whole numbers, fractions, or even irrational numbers</em>.
          </p>
          <p>Numerals, on the other hand, are the symbols we use to represent these numbers. For example, the number "five"
             can be represented by the numeral "5" in Arabic numerals or "V" in Roman numerals or "ðŸ”µ ðŸ”µ ðŸ”µ  
             ðŸ”µ ðŸ”µ
           " in pictorials.

            How would life be different without numbers? Talk with your classmates and list five things you do every day that involve numbers.

            Some examples to help you think:
            
                How do we know what time to wake up or go to school?
            
                How do farmers measure land or seeds?
            
                How do we know how much to pay at the shop?
            
                How do we count people in class?
            
                How do doctors know the right amount of medicine?

                   1. Outside the classroom, learners to stand in a circle and be assigned a number starting from <m>1 </m> to the last person.
                 </p>
                 <p>
                   2. The student assigned number <m> 1</m> to stay standing and the student with number <m> 2</m> will sit down first. 
                 </p>
                 <p>
                    3. After number <m> 2</m> sits, skip the next student at number <m> 3</m> and ask the student with number <m> 4 </m> to sit down.
                       Fellow learners to shout out the next number to sit down.
                 </p>
                 <p>
                   4. Continue with this pattern where each student who sits down will skip the next student and have the student after them sit down.
                      So after number <m>4</m> sits, number <m>6</m> will sit, then number <m>8</m>, and so on.
                 </p>
                 <p>
                     5. Once all even-numbered students have sat down, the students still standing will shout out their numbers one by one.

    A prime number is a number that has only two divisors, that is, <m>1</m> and the number itself.
  </p>
  <p>
    <m>2</m> is the only prime number that is even
  </p>
  <p>
   <m>1</m> is not a prime number because it has only one divisor.

        By performing division, the expression is reduced to :
      </p>
      <p>
        <m>524 + 256 - 137</m>
      </p>
      <p>
        Next we add: <m>524 + 256 = 780</m>
      </p>
      <p>
        <m> = 780 - 137 = 643</m>
      </p>
      <p>
        Therefore, <m>524 + 256 - 548 \div 4 = 643</m>

      <p>
        The task involves <m>4</m> operations and we perform it in the following order: division, multiplication, addition then subtraction.

      <p>
        <m>546 \div 2 = 273</m>
      </p>
      <p>

      </p>
      <p>
        <m>= 273 \times 12 = 3276</m>
      </p>
      <p>
        <m>3276 - 1254 + 3546 </m> rewriting this to perform addition we get:
      </p>
      <p>
        <m>3276 + 3546 = 6822</m>
      </p>
      <p>
        Finally, we subtract:

      <p>
        <m>6822- 1254 = 5568</m>

            <m>\textbf{What are rational numbers?}</m>
            A <m>\textbf{rational number}</m> is any number that can be made by dividing two integers.
        </p>
         <p>
            Remember that integers can be positive numbers, negative numbers or zero, but they cannot have fractional or decimal parts.
            All rational numbers can be written in the form
            <m>\frac{p}{q}</m>
            where p and q are integers and q is not zero.
         </p>
         <p>
            <m>\frac{2}{3}</m>is a rational number. </p>
         <p>
            <m>-5</m> is a rational number because it can be written as
            <m>\frac{-5}{1}</m>
        </p>
         <p>
          4.75 is a rational number because it can be written as <m>\frac{19}{4}</m>
         </p>
         <p>         
          0.36  is a rational number because it can be written as <m>\frac{9}{25}</m>
         </p>
         <p>
         1.18 is a rational number because it can be written as <m>\frac{13}{11}</m>
         </p>
         <p>
         Integers, fractions, terminating decimal and repeating decimals are all rational numbers.

         <m>\textbf{A rational number}</m>
            is any number that can be made by dividing two integers. Rational numbers can be positive, negative, or zero. They can be integers, fractions, terminating decimals and repeating decimals.
            <m>\textbf{Adding rational numbers}</m></p>
         <p>
          To add rational numbers, follow these steps:
         </p>
         <p>
          Make sure both two numbers to be added have the same form. They should both be fractions or both be decimals. If the numbers are fractions, write them to have common denominators
       </p>
      <p>
         Look at the signs of the numbers to be added to determine how to solve. If the addends have the same sign add their absolute values
      </p>
       <p>
         If the addends have different signs, subtract the lesser absolute value from the greater absolute value.
         Determine the sign of the sum. If the rational numbers have the same sign, the sum will have that sign. If the addends have different signs, the sum will have the sign of the addend with the greater absolute value.

         </p>
         <p>
          Now look at the sign of the rational numbers to be added they are the same that is (-) and a positive number times a negative number is a negative one so our answer will be:

       <p>

       <p>
            Lastly, determine the sign of the sum. Since bth addends are negative, the sum will also be negative

         Subtracting rational numbers with differrent signs.
            Subtracting a number is the same as adding its opposite
            For example, 5 â€“ 2 is the same as 5 + (-2)
           
            So, you can rewrite a subtraction expression as addition of the opposite. Then, follow the rules for adding rational numbers.
         </p>
            <example>
               <statement>
                  <p>
                   Solve <m>8\frac{3}{5} + (-2.5)</m>
                  </p>
               </statement>
               <solution>
                  <p>
                     First we write the numbers in the same form. Write <m>8\frac{3}{5}</m> as a decimal i.e <m> (8 \times 5 = 40 + 3 = \frac{43}{5} = 8.6 )</m>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     Since the signs of the addends are different , so subtract the lesser absolute value from the greater absolute value.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     So <m>8\frac{3}{5} + (-2.5) = 8.6 -2.5 = 6.1</m> 
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     Since the positive number in our sum is larger than the negative one the sum is positive i.e :
                     <m>8\frac{3}{5} + (-2.5)</m> = 6.1

                You can order rational numbers using what you know about comparing rational numbers.
           </p>
            <p>
              To order rational numbers, follow these steps:
            </p>
             <p>
             1. Write the numbers in the same form. You can write them all as fractions or all as decimals.
               
            </p>
            <p>
             2. Compare the numbers. You can use a number line to help you compare the numbers.
               
            </p>
            <p>
             3. Write the numbers in order from least to greatest or from greatest to least.
           </p>
          <example>
            <statement>
               <p>
                  Put these rational numbers in order from least to greatest:
          
                 <m>\frac{1}{2}, \frac{3}{4}, \frac{1}{3}, \frac{2}{5}</m>
         
               </p>
            </statement>
            <solution>
               <p>
                  First, write the numbers in the same form. Write all the numbers as fractions.
                  <m>\frac{1}{2} = \frac{5}{10}, \frac{3}{4} = \frac{15}{20}, \frac{1}{3} = \frac{10}{30}, \frac{2}{5} = \frac{12}{30}</m>
                  Now, compare the fractions. 
               </p>
               <p> 
                  To compare fractions, look at the denominators and find theit LCM.
                  The LCM of 10, 20, and 30 is 60.

               <p> 
                  Since negative numbers are always less than positive numbers,
                  â€“<m>\frac{1}{2}</m> is the smallest number.

                  <p> 
               Look at the whole number parts. Since 1 is less than 2, 1.9 comes next.

                  <p>
                     write both numbers in the same form. Write <m>2\frac{3}{10}</m>
                  as a decimal.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                  <m>2\frac{3}{10}</m> = 2.3 Since 2.3 is less than 2.32, <m>2\frac{3}{10}</m> comes next.
                     
                  </p>
                  <p>
                  That leaves 2.32 as the largest number.

         What are irrational numbers?
         Any number that is not rational is irrational.
         An irrational number cannot be made by dividing two integers.

         How do you compare rational numbers?
         When you compare rational numbers, it often helps to use a number line.
         It can also help to write both numbers in the same form. You can write them both as fractions or as decimals. If the numbers are fractions, you can write them to have a common denominator
         to make them easier to compare.
        </p>
         <example>
            <statement>
               <p>
                  Compare 0.2 and -0.4
               </p>
            </statement>
            <solution>
               <p>
                 Since 0.2 is positive and -0.4 is negative, 0.2 is greater than -0.4
                 .
                 The number 0.2 is farther right on the number line.

            Skip counting can also be referred to as Number Sequence.

         <p>Number sequence</p>
    <p>
            A number sequence is a list of numbers that follow a specific pattern or rule. 
        </p>
        <p>
            Think of it like a list of numbers where each number is related to the one before it in a certain way e.g <m>2, 4, 6, 8, 10, ...</m>
            Here, you are adding 2 each time. These are all numbers that can be divided by 2.
        </p> 
        <p>
            The pattern could involve adding, subtracting, multiplying, or dividing by a certain number each time.

        </p>
        <p>
            Look for the pattern. Identify if the numbers are increasing or decreasing. Find out if there is consistent amount being added or subtracted.
        </p>
        <p>
            See if you can predict the next number based on the rule you find.

        </statement>
           <solution>
            <p>
               1. The first step is to find the differences between consecutive numbers:
            </p>
            <p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <p>
                           <m>400 - 50 = 350 </m>
                        </p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>
                            <m>850 - 400 = 450</m>
                        </p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>
                            <m>1400 - 850 = 550</m>
                        </p>
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </p>
            <p>
                So, the differences are <m>350\, ,450\,, 550\,</m> which are increasing by <m>100</m> each time.
            </p>
            <p>
                 2. Next step is to predict the next differences:
            </p>
            <p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <p>
                           <m> 550 + 100 = 650</m> (the next difference)
                        </p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>
                            <m>650 + 100 = 750</m> (the following difference)
                            
                        </p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>
                           <m> 750 + 100 = 850 </m>(the last difference)
                        </p>
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </p>
            <p>
                3.Add these differences to the last known number (1400):
            </p>
            <p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <p>
                           <m>1400 + 650 = 2050 </m>
                        </p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>
                            <m>2050 + 750 = 2800</m>
                        </p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>
                            <m>2800 + 850 = 3650</m>
                        </p>
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </p>
            <p>
                So the missing numbers are <m>2050 \,,2800\,,3650 </m>
            </p>
            <p>
                4. Finally, the sequence is <m>50\, ,400\,, 850\, ,1400\, ,2050\, ,2800\, ,3650</m>
            </p>

                    When rearranged in ascending order, we get:

            Why Do We Use Base-10 Numbers?
    
              We use base-10 because we have 10 fingers to count with! This system helps us understand place value.
    
              For example:
    
                  The number 127 means:
    
                      1 hundred (100)
    
                      2 tens (20)
    
                      7 ones (7)
    
              This helps us add, subtract, and work with big numbers easily.
          </p>
          <example>
            <statement>
              <p>
                The number of malaria tablets that were produced by a pharmaceutical company over a certain period was 213 587 915. Round off this number to the nearest hundreds of million.
    
              </p>
            </statement>
            <solution>
                 <p>
                  To round off a number to the nearest hundreds of millions, we identify if the digit at the tens of millions place value is greater,less or equal to <m>5</m>.
                </p>
                <p>
                  If the digit in the tens of millions place value is greater or equal to <m>5</m> then add <m>1</m> to the digit in the hundreds of million place value and replace the remaining digits with zeros.
                </p>
                <p>
                  If the digit in the tens of millions place value is less than <m>5</m> then maintain the digit in the hundreds of million place value and replace the remaining digits with zeros.
                </p>
              <p>
                Since the digit in the hundreds of millions place value is <m>2</m> and the digit in the tens of millions place value is <m>1</m>, we replace the digits on the right hand side of <m>2</m> with zeros.
              </p>
            
              <p>
               Therefore, <m>213\, 587 \,915</m> to the nearest hundred million becomes <m>200\, 000 \,000</m>

                <p>
                  If the digit in the millions place value is greater or equal to <m>5</m> then add <m>1</m> to the digit in the tens of million place value and replace the remaining digits with zeros.

                Digit <m>7</m>  is in the place value of millions. We add one to digit <m>8</m> in the tens of millions place value and replace the remaining digits by zero.
