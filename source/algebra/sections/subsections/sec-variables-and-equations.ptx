  <title>Variables and Equations</title>

  <introduction>
    <p>
      A variable is a symbol, usually a letter, that represents an unknown number. For example, in the expression <m>2x + 5</m>, <m>x</m> is a variable.
      An equation is a mathematical sentence that shows two values are equal. It usually contains variables and can be solved to find their values.

    <title>Understanding Variables</title>

    <example>
      <title>What is a Variable?</title>
      <statement>
        <p>Kojo buys <m>x</m> pencils at ₵2 each. What does the expression <m>2x</m> represent?</p>
      </statement>
      <solution>
        <p>It represents the total cost of <m>x</m> pencils at ₵2 each.</p>
        <p>If <m>x = 3</m>, then total cost = <m>2 × 3 = ₵6</m>.</p>
      </solution>
    </example>

    <exercise>
      <p>Amina saves ₵5 each day. Write an expression for the amount she saves in <m>d</m> days. What is the total for 6 days?</p>
    </exercise>

    <title>Forming Equations from Real-Life Problems</title>

    <p>
      When we know the total and want to find a missing number, we form an equation using a variable.
    </p>

    <example>
      <title>Using an Equation</title>
      <statement>
        <p>Kwame spends ₵12 on transport and ₵x on food. If his total expense is ₵20, write and solve the equation.</p>
      </statement>
      <solution>
        <p>Equation: <m>12 + x = 20</m></p>
        <p>Solve: <m>x = 20 - 12 = ₵8</m></p>
      </solution>
    </example>

    <exercise>
      <p>Sarah has ₵x. She gets ₵5 more from her friend. If she now has ₵17, write and solve an equation to find <m>x</m>.</p>
    </exercise>

    <title>Equations vs Expressions</title>

    <p>
      An <em>expression</em> does not have an equal sign. An <em>equation</em> has an equal sign and shows equality.
    </p>

    <example>
      <title>Compare the Two</title>
      <statement>
        <p>Identify which of the following are equations and which are expressions:</p>
        <p>
            <ul>
                <li><m>4x + 3</m></li>
                <li><m>4x + 3 = 11</m></li>
            </ul>
        </p>
      </statement>
      <solution>
        <p><m>4x + 3</m> is an expression.</p>
        <p><m>4x + 3 = 11</m> is an equation.</p>
      </solution>
    </example>

    <exercise>
      <p>
        Write an expression and an equation based on this situation:  
        “A student spends ₵x on pens and ₵10 on books. The total cost is ₵25.”
      </p>

    <exercise>
      <p>Form and solve an equation: “₵3 is added to a number and the result is ₵15.”</p>
    </exercise>

    <exercise>
      <p>Which of the following is an equation?</p>
      <p>
        (a) <m>2x + 4</m>
