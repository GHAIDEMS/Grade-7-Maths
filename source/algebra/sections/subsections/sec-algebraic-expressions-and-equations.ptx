  <title>Algebraic Expressions and Equations</title>

  <introduction>
    <p>
      Algebra is not only about symbols—it helps us solve real-life problems. In this section, you will learn to use algebraic expressions and equations in situations like budgeting, sharing, and calculating distance and time.

    <title>Solving Real-Life Problems</title>

    <example>
      <title>Shopping Budget</title>
      <statement>
        <p>
          Mansa goes to the market with ₵50. She buys <m>x</m> tubers of yam at ₵6 each and spends ₵8 on vegetables.
          Write an expression for the total amount spent and find how many yams she bought if she spent all her money.
        </p>
      </statement>
      <solution>
        <p>Total cost = <m>6x + 8</m></p>
        <p>Since she spent all her money: <m>6x + 8 = 50</m></p>
        <p>Solve: <m>6x = 42</m> → <m>x = 7</m></p>
      </solution>
    </example>

    <exercise>
      <p>
        Kwabena wants to buy <m>x</m> pens at ₵3 each and a notebook for ₵12. If he spends ₵30, write and solve the equation to find how many pens he bought.

    <title>Sharing and Equal Distribution</title>

    <example>
      <title>Sharing Money</title>
      <statement>
        <p>
          Five students share ₵x equally. Each receives ₵20. What is the value of <m>x</m>?
        </p>
      </statement>
      <solution>
        <p><m>x ÷ 5 = 20</m></p>
        <p>Multiply both sides by 5: <m>x = 100</m></p>
      </solution>
    </example>

    <exercise>
      <p>
        Afua and her 3 friends share a basket of oranges equally. If each receives 6 oranges, how many oranges were in the basket?

    <title>Time, Money, and Distance Problems</title>

    <example>
      <title>Calculating Distance</title>
      <statement>
        <p>
          A car travels at a speed of 60 km/h. Write an expression for the distance travelled in <m>t</m> hours. How far will it go in 3 hours?
        </p>
      </statement>
      <solution>
        <p>Distance = <m>60t</m></p>
        <p>For <m>t = 3</m>: <m>60 × 3 = 180 km</m></p>
      </solution>
    </example>

    <exercise>
      <p>
        A man earns ₵15 per hour. Write an expression for his earnings after <m>h</m> hours. Calculate his earnings for 8 hours.
