        <title>Number Patterns</title>
        <p>
        A number pattern is a sequence of numbers that follow a particular rule. Understanding patterns helps us make predictions and solve problems.

        <example>
        <title>Increasing Pattern</title>
        <statement>
            <p></p>
            <p>
            Write the next two terms of this pattern and describe the rule: <m>5, 10, 20, 40, ...</m>
            </p>
            <p>Find the rule and the next two terms in the sequence: <m>3, 6, 9, 12, ...</m></p>
        </statement>
        <solution>
            <p>Each number increases by 3. This is an arithmetic pattern.</p>
            <p>Next terms: <m>15, 18</m></p>
        </solution>
        </example>

        <exercise>
        <statement>
            <p>Describe a real-life pattern you have noticed and write an algebraic expression for it.</p>
        </statement>
        </exercise>

        <exercise>
            <p>Write the next two terms of this pattern and describe the rule: <m>5, 10, 20, 40, ...</m></p>
            <p>Each term is multiplied by 2. The next terms are <m>80, 160</m>.</p>
        </exercise>
