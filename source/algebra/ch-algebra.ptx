      <term>Introduction to Algebra</term>
    </p>

    <p>
      Algebra helps us to represent and solve everyday problems using letters and symbols. It is useful when we need to describe patterns, calculate costs, or solve unknowns. In this chapter, you will learn to form and simplify algebraic expressions, substitute values, and solve simple equations.
    </p>

    <p>
      Algebra uses letters like <m>x</m> or <m>y</m> to stand for numbers we do not yet know. These letters are called variables.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      
      For example, in the equation:
    </p>

    <p>
      Ama buys <m>5</m> loaves of bread. Each loaf costs ₵<m>x</m>. What is the total cost?
    </p>

    <figure>
      <caption>Illustration of Ama buying bread in the market.</caption>
      <image source="bread.png" width="50%" />
    </figure>

    <p>
      Total cost = Number of loaves of bread <m>\times</m> Cost of each loaf
    </p>
    <p>
      Total cost = <m>5x</m>.  
    </p>

    <p>
      The letter x is a variable, meaning it can change.
    </p>

    <p>
      If <m>x = 3</m>, then total cost = <m>5 \times 3 = ₵15</m> 
    </p>

    <p>
      <term>Why is Algebra Important?</term>
    </p>

    <p>
      Algebra is useful in many real-life situations, such as:

      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>
            <term>Shopping:</term> If a shirt costs <m>p</m> cedi and you buy 3 shirts, the total cost is 3p cedi.
          </p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <p>
            <term>Traveling:</term> If a car moves at a speed of <m>s</m> km per hour, the distance traveled in <m>t</m> hours is <m>s \times t</m> km.
          </p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <p>
            <term>Problem-solving:</term> Many scientific and technical fields, such as engineering, computer science, and medicine, use algebra to make calculations and predictions.
          </p>
        </li>
      </ul>
    </p>
