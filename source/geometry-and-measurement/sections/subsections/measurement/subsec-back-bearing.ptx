    <title>Back Bearing</title>
        <p>
        Back bearing is a fundamental concept in navigation and surveying. 
        It refers to the direction opposite to the direction of a given bearing. 
        In other words, the back bearing is the bearing from the destination point 
        back to the starting point.

    <p>
        If the fore bearing (the direction from point A to point B) is known, the back bearing (from point B to point A) 
        can be calculated by adding or subtracting <m>180^\circ</m> depending on the value of the fore bearing.
    </p>
    <p>
        For example, if the fore bearing is less than <m>180^\circ</m>, the back bearing is found by adding <m>180^\circ</m>. 
        If the fore bearing is greater than <m>180^\circ</m>, the back bearing is found by subtracting <m>180^\circ</m>.
