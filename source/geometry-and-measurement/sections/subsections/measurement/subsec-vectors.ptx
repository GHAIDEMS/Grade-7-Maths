        Suppose I ask, "<em>How far is your home from school?</em>" One possible response is " <em><m>2</m> kilometers</em>." 
        However, I can't get to your home with just this information.
        I would also need to know the direction, whether it is <alert>east</alert>, <alert>west</alert>, <alert>northeast</alert>, or <alert>south</alert>. 
        This combination of both distance and direction is what a <term>vector</term> represents.

        <alert>Vectors</alert> are concepts in mathematics that extend beyond just numbers. 
        Suppose I ask, "How far is your home from school?". You might respond with "<m>2</m> kilometers."
        However, this information alone is not enough for me to get to your home. 
        To reach your destination, I would also need to know the direction, 
        whether it is east, west, northeast, or south. 
        This combination of both distance and direction is what a vector represents.

        <alert>Pilots</alert> use vectors to calculate the distance and direction
        they need to take inorder to travel from one location to another. 
        In this section, we will explore how to use vectors and apply different operations on them.

        <alert>A vector</alert> is a quantity that has <alert>both</alert> 
        magnitude and direction, whereas <alert>a scalar</alert> is a quantity
        which has <alert>only</alert> magnitude.
    </p>
    <p>
        Examples of <alert>vector</alert> quantities include force, 
        velocity, and displacement, while <alert>scalar</alert> 
        quantities include mass,temperature, and speed etc.
