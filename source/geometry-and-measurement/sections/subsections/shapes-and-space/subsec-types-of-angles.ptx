    <title>Types of Angles</title>
    <p>
        Angles are classified according to their sizes.

        <ol>
            <li>
                <p>
                    <term>Right Angle</term> - A perfect <m>90^\circ</m> angle, just like the corners of a square or the edges of a notebook.
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>
                    <term>Acute Angle</term> - This angle is less than <m>90^\circ</m>. It looks small and sharp, like the tip of a pencil! 
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>
                    <term>Obtuse Angle</term> - This angle is greater than <m>90^\circ</m> but less than <m>180^\circ</m>. It looks wide and open, like a door halfway open.
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>
                    <term>Reflex Angle</term> - This is an angle that is greater than <m>180^\circ</m> but less than <m>360^\circ</m>. 
                    It appears when two lines extend beyond a straight angle, forming a large outward bend.
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>
                    <term>Straight Angle</term> - A <m>180^\circ</m> angle, which forms a straight lineâ€”like the horizon!
                </p>
            </li>
        </ol>

            Here is an interactive activity for you to explore the different types of angles.

            Use the spy glass by dragging it over the objects in the given picture.
             You can click on the 'NEW PICTURE' button to get a new image.

            What angles have you discovered from this activity?
        </p>

        <p>
            Now, explore the objects around you and find the different types of angles in your sorrounding. What angles did you find?

            <term>Key Takeaway</term>
        </p>
        <p>
            Did you know one of the real life applications of angles is in <em>Carpentary?</em> 
        </p>

        <p>
            For example, when carpenters are making a chair, 
            they use angles to cut the wood so that the legs of the chair slants at the desired angle thereby creating a stable and beautiful designs.  
        </p>

        <p>   
            
            They typically use a combination of measuring tools, like a protractor and a combination square, to mark the angles on the wood before cutting, often aiming for a slight outward slant on the legs for stability and comfort
