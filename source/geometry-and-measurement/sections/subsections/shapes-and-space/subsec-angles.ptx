                    The word angle comes from the latin word <em>angulus</em>, meaning <q>corner</q>. An angle is represented by the symbol <m>\angle.</m> 
                </p>

                <p>
                    Angles are formed when two lines intersect at point (also known as <em>vertex </em>). In geometry, an angle is formed when two rays are joined at their endpoints. Rays are also known as sides or arms of the angle.

                               Angles are formed when two rays intersect at a vertex. The opening between the two rays is called an angle, represented by a symbol <m>\angle .</m>

                               An angle is described as a 'opening' formed by two rays/lines meeting at a vertex.
