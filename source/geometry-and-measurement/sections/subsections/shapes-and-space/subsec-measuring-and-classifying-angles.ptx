    <title>Measuring and Classifying Angles</title>

        <p>
            Have you ever noticed how doors open at different angles or how the hands of a clock form different shapes throughout the day? 
            These angles are everywhere in our world! To measure them, we use a special tool called a protractor.
        </p>
        <p>
            A protractor is a half-circle tool with numbers marked around its edge. 
            It helps us find out exactly how wide or narrow an angle is in degrees. Just like rulers measure length, protractors measure angles!
        </p>
        <p>
            A protractor is marked with degrees from <m>0^\circ</m> to <m>180^\circ</m>. It can be directly used to measure any angle from <m>0^\circ</m> to <m>360^\circ</m> .
             The markings are made in two ways, <m>0^\circ</m> to <m>180^\circ</m>  from right to left and vice versa.

            <p>
                Suppose we have an angle to measure say, <m>\angle ABC</m>. Follow the steps given below to measure the angle.
            </p>
    
            <p>
                <ol>
                    <li>
                        <p>
                            Put the protractor above the line <m>BC</m> such that the midpoint of protractor is at point <m>B</m>.
                        </p>                          
                    </li>
    
                    <li>
                        <p>
                            Adjust the protractor in such a way that <m>BC</m> is parallel to the straight-edge of the protractor.
                        </p>
                    </li>
    
                    <li>
                        <p>
                            The protractor has two scales marked from <m>0^\circ</m> to <m>180^\circ</m> on both the ends. Take the reading where <m>BC</m> coincides with the <m>0^\circ</m>.
                        </p>
                    </li>
    
                    <li>
                        <p>
                            Now from <m>0^\circ</m>, check the line <m>BA</m> coincides with the curved edges of the protractor. 
                            This reading gives us the measure of angle <m>ABC</m>.
                        </p>
                    </li>
                </ol>

                Use a protractor to measure angles and classify them as acute, right, obtuse, reflex or straight.
