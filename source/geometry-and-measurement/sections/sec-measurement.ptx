    <title>Measurement</title>
    <introduction>
        <p>
            Measurement helps us find out how long, wide, or far things are. We use it every day  when building, cooking, or 
            even drawing. In this topic, we will learn how to measure the edges and spaces of different shapes, including how to find the perimeter and area using simple formulas.
